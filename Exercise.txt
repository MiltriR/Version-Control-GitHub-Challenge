1.	Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

A terminal is like a window or a tool that I can use to send commands to my 
computer. It makes it easier to navigate terminals and create different
files, all from the terminal window.

2.	What is the major difference between Git and Github?

The major difference between GIt and GitHub is that "Git" is based on your 
local system and GitHub is cloud-based. But allow to have a repository of your
code history but "Git" is in your local computer while "GitHub" saves your    
repository in the clouds. 

3.	Why do we use Github?

Because GitHub allows us to share our code with a co-worker and work together on
a project simultaneously. You can back up your Git repositories in the cloud,
share your code and collaborate with others
